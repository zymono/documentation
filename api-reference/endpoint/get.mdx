## Step 1:
Insert one of the code snippets on the right into your IDE.

## Step 2: Modify
Edit Your_Panel_Key_Here to your panel key which you can find at: https://zymono.com/me/

If your IDE supports storing variable secrets then we recommend that you store Your_Panel_Key_Here in one, otherwise anyone can steal it and create their own api page with your panel.
