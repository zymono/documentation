The API requires authentication so that only you and your team can access your API information.

```javascript
const apiToken = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE'
```

## API Tokens

Your API token is the same as your panel token, which can be found by visiting [https://zymono.com/me](https://zymono.com/me) and hitting reveal under panel token.

You should store your API token in an environment variable so that users can see it as it must remain private.

### Permissions

This API key will grant you access to all of your information retrievable by the API.

This API key can be revoked by us at anytime!
