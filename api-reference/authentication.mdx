The API requires authentication so that only you and your team can access your API information.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

## API Tokens

Your API Key can be found in the API tab of the dashboard.

You should store your API Key in an environment variable so that users can see it as it must remain private.

### Permissions

This API Key will grant you access to all of your information retrievable by the API.

This API Key can be revoked by us at anytime!
