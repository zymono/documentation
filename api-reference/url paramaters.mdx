`g` = Platform's ID

`n` = Username of user being reported

`r` = Reason of user being reported

`p` = What device/website the user was on

`img` = Image URL of evidence. (Image/Gif)

## zymono.com/report

`
https://zymono.com/report/?g={game_ID}&n={username}&r-{reason}&p={device/website}&img={image}
`

## report.zymono.com

`
https://report.zymono.com/{game_ID}&n={username}&r-{reason}&p={device/website}&img={image}
`

You can leave the URL Paramaters blank and then the user will have to enter the answer manually.

Linking a domain at https://zymono.com/link will make it so that when the platform is set to your linked domain with URL Paramaters, it will automatically fill out your Report ID/Platform ID.
