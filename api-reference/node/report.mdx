Once you have installed and initalized the Zymono NPM package, you can file a report. If you have not completed this step please refer to /api-reference/node/install

## File Report

To file a report, use the `report` function.

```js
const { report } = require('zymono')

const params = {
  id: '', //Panel Key from https://zymono.com/me/ (Same as API key)
  user: '', //User being reported
  imgURL: '', //Url of an image for evidence (You can leave this blank)
  reason: '', //Reason for report
  device: '' //Platform (E.g. Minecraft, Xbox, Discord, etc)
}

report(params)
```
