The API requires authentication so that only you and your team can access your API information.

## API Tokens

Your API Key can be found by visiting [https://zymono.com/api](https://zymono.com/api) and clicking reveal under API Key.

You should store your API Key in an environment variable so that users cannot see it, as it must remain private.

```sh .env
API_KEY = 'Your API Key'
```

You can you tools like dotenv to data in environment variables.

## Initiate the API

Initiate the API with the following code

```js
zymono.init("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### Permissions

This API key will grant you access to all of your information retrievable by the API.

This API key can be revoked by us at anytime!
