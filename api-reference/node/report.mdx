## File Report

To file a report, use the `report` function.

```js
const params = {
  user: '', //User being reported
  imgURL: '', //Url of an image for evidence (You can leave this blank)
  reason: '', //Reason for report
  device: '' //Platform (E.g. Minecraft, Xbox, Discord, etc)
}

zymono.report(params)
```
